Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs,treat each file separately?
-> Git is mainly ment for version control of code where files depend on each other..Google docs are for more generic files which may include others forms of docs So, treating files 
as unconnected individual elements makes sense for google docs.
